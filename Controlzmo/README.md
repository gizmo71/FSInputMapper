Gizmo's Controlzmo
==================

Designed mostly to enhance interaction with the default A320neo in MSFS (aka FSFS2020).

When running, it will attempt to attached SimConnect to MSFS every couple of seconds until it succeeds, and should cope gracefully if it exits.

Would have to have a WASM module to send client events we could RX.

On landing, would be good to detect spoilers popping, reversers, and decel light.
